    Please be patient and if anything is unclear and please feel free to contact the developers.

autoDEER is a spectrometer independent Python package developed to enable push-button
fully automated DEER. The program is built around a well established and tested optimised algorithum. 
It can be either interfaced using the user friendly GUI or via Python code. Additionally, the backend "autoEPR" can 
be used to build new projects.
