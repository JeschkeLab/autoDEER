There are two mains ways of using autoDEER:

1. Using the GUI (recommended):
    The graphical user interface (GUI) is the easiest way of using autoDEER.
    This is a mostly self-explantory process but detailed instructions are also provided. 

2. Using the programable interface:
    Each function of autoDEER can be accessed and called, often with 
    modifiable parameters. This allows users to develop their own custom autoDEER
    protocol.
