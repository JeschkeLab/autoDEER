.. py:class:: QtLogHandler(level=logging.NOTSET)


   Bases: :py:obj:`PyQt6.QtCore.QObject`, :py:obj:`logging.Handler`

   Handler instances dispatch logging events to specific destinations.

   The base handler class. Acts as a placeholder which defines the Handler
   interface. Handlers can optionally use Formatter instances to format
   records as desired. By default, no formatter is specified; in this case,
   the 'raw' message as determined by record.message is logged.


   Initializes the instance - basically setting the formatter to None
   and the filter list to empty.

   .. py:attribute:: signal

      

   .. py:method:: emit(record)

      
      Do whatever it takes to actually log the specified logging record.

      This version is intended to be implemented by subclasses and so
      raises a NotImplementedError.
