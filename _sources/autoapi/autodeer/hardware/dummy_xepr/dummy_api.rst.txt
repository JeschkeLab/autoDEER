   .. py:method:: acquire_scan()

      
      This script detects the end of the scan and acquires the data set. 
      This requires that the experiment is still running, or recently 
      finished. Once it has been saved this will no longer work.

   .. py:method:: acquire_scan_2d()

      
      This function acquires the dataset after a full 2D scan.
      This is done by identifying the number of scan steps per sweep and 
      acquiring the data on that scan.
      This requires that the experiment has not been saved.

   .. py:method:: set_PulseSpel_var(variable, value)

      
      This can be used to change any pulse spell variable whilst the 
      experiment is running. These changes take effect at the beginning of 
      the next scan
