   Bases: :py:obj:`HahnEchoSequence`

   Represents a reptime scan of a Hahn Echo Sequence. 


   A Hahn echo sequence is perfomed with the shot repetition time increasing.1


   :Parameters:

           The B0 field, in Guass

       **LO** : int or float
           The LO frequency in GHz

       **reptime: float**
           The default reptime, this is used for tuning pulses etc...

       **reptime_max** : np.ndarray
           The maximum shot repetition time in us    

       **averages** : int
           The number of scans.

       **shots** : int
